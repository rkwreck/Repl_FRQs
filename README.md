# Guide/Walkthrough to Rini's FRQS
Wiki page with tangibles/pictures associated with each step can be accessed [here](https://github.com/rkwreck/team_flappy_bird/wiki/Guide-&-Tangibles:-Rini-FRQ-Showing-2-(Week-8)).

1. To run the FRQs, click the "run" button at the top of the Repl.
2. Give it a few seconds to start. Then, it will prompt you to choose an FRQ from a menu. Type the number that corresponds to the FRQ.
3. The FRQ will then run. The first thing an FRQ does when it runs is give a print statement to tell you what it will do. It may also have statements while running so you can make sense of the outputs. After an FRQ completes its run, the menu will prompt you to choose another one. Here is an example. The user chose FRQ 3 (selection 2). After FRQ 3 is completed, the user is prompted to pick another FRQ to run.
4. These FRQS use input: FRQ2, FRQ3, FRQ4, FRQ5. Examples of how these inputs look like can be found on the wiki page linked above.
